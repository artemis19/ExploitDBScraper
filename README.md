# ExploitDBScraper

-----------------------------------

Scraping the ExploitDB repository to use the data in a visualization project.

## Add ExploitDB Repository as submodule

Package repository into my own:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb
```

## Important Data Fields

```
Date of release
Exploit Title
Type
Platform
Tag(s)
Filename
File Extension
Filesize
File hash
```

The file `file_exploits.csv` and the repository data contain the following variables with accurate information:

1. Filename, part of `file` variable
2. File Extension, part of `file` variable
3. Exploit Title, `description` variable
4. Type
5. Platform
6. Filesize (Can extract this from the repository files)
7. Hash (Can extract this from the files)

The Date was included as a field, but every exploit was labeled with the same release date: `1970-01-01`.

The two remaining fields that we need to scrape from the github repository or website are:

1. Date
2. Tag(s)

After messing with the data in the CSV, I ended up deciding to actually scrape everything, with exception to the actual files, from the website since there appeared to be no easy way to get accurate dates or tags from the github repository, and it would have been more work to try to put the two separate datasets together versus getting everything from one location. This was done using the `scraper.py` script.

## Data Parsing

This scraper was made for creating a dataset that could be imported into Tableau to create visualizations. The `parser.py` script is meant to extract the relevant data fields and also clean the data for duplicate exploits (those that share the same files). Exploits that are created for the same CVE will not be considered duplicate if they are written in separate languages or perform a different attack vector even if it's for the same vulnerability, as that will show how impactful that particular vulnerability was in that multiple exploits were created for it.

## Notes

`exploitdb/exploits` is organized by `platform` subdirectories, which then has the type underneath:

```
+ exploits
----+ platform
	----+ type
```

Since the data is about 50MB, we can't upload that directly, but we can compress a copy as a back-up.
